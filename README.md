# Hello there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! This is going to feature articles, MATLAB code snippets and more stuff related to quantitative finance and statistics.

## About me 🙋‍♂️

* 👨‍🎓 I went to high school to become an IT technician, I have a Maths BSc and I'm on my way to get a double degree in Quantitative Finance;
* 👨‍💻 I know a little bit of everything (`C`, `Java`, `.sh`, `.py`, ...);
* ✍🏻 I like to write and share knowledge! [This](https://www.unica.it/unica/protected/287911/0/def/ref/MAT287227/) is an article I wrote under supervision about some results on multivalued functions (in Italian);
* 🌱 Learning all about stochastic calculus, asset & risk management and computational finance;
* 🏎️ If it's got an engine and it is possible to make it go faster than intended, I'm probably into it! (yes, even [lawnmower racing](https://youtu.be/brgep8R73u8));
* 🗺️ Languages spoken: `ita`, `lij`, `srd`, `eng`.
