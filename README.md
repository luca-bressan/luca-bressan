# Hello there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub page! This is going to feature articles, MATLAB code snippets and more stuff related to quantitative finance and statistics. As of right now, it is empty... How did you even find this?

## About me 🙋‍♂️
* 👨‍🎓 I went to high school to become an IT technician, I have a Maths BSc and I'm on my way to get a double degree in Quantitative Finance;
* 👨‍💻 I know a little bit of everything (`C`, `Java`, `.sh`, `.py`, ...) but my main interest is in `MATLAB`;
* ✍🏻 I like to write and share knowledge! [This](https://www.unica.it/unica/protected/287911/0/def/ref/MAT287227/) is an article I wrote under supervision about some results on multivalued functions (in Italian);
* 🌱 Learning all about stochastic calculus, asset & risk management and computational finance;
* 🏎️ If it's got an engine and it is possible to make it go faster than intended, I'm probably into it! (yes, even [lawnmower racing](https://youtu.be/brgep8R73u8)).

## Blog posts 📊
They're coming... Work in progress!
