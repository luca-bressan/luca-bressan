# Hello there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub page! This is going to feature articles, MATLAB code snippets and more stuff related to quantitative finance and statistics. As of right now, it is empty... How did you even find this?

## About me 🙋‍♂️
* **STUDYING** 👨‍🎓: I went to high school to become an IT technician, I have a Maths BSc and I'm on my way to get a double degree in Quantitative Finance;
* **CODING** 👨‍💻: I know a little bit of everything ('C','Java','.sh',...) but my main interest is 'MATLAB';
